# MiniSeg Project
Source code for the MiniSeg Real-Time Systems course project of Lund University. 
It enables the MinSeg robot ([Visit website](https://minseg.com/)) to balance itself and to follow translational position setpoints.
Additionally, a graphical user interface to communicate with the robot and to tune the controller is provided. The communication takes place via Bluetooth.

# Setup
This repository contains both the Arduino code and the graphical user interface. For running the latter, a python environment is necessary.
## GUI
The graphical user interface is built using the Qt framework and its python bindings. The python environment can be 
built using Python 3.10 ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) by 
typing:
```powershell
cd gui  # Source directory should be miniseg/gui!
<Python 3.10 install dir>\python.exe -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```
Before running `main.py` some resources must be generated by running the build script from the repository root directory.
```powershell
# Make sure to run this in a Windows Powershell terminal!
.\build.ps1
```
If Windows doesn't allow you to run Powershell scripts, then you might have to set the execution policy according to
```powershell
# Make sure to run this in a Windows Powershell terminal!
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
